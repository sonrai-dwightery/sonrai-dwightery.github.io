For users who wish to use it, Sonrai Security provides shared slack channels for collaboration.  We can setup a shared channel with your company's existing slack instance, or if you're not a slack user, we can provide guest access to a channel hosted by us.

If you're interested in setting up a shared channel, ask your slack administrator to setup a channel with an appropriate name, and send the shared slack channel invitation to dwight.spencer@sonraisecurity.com.  We'll complete the configuration process on our side & invite the members of our team for you to communicate with. 

thanks,
dwight
